        <p class="boldweight" id="bad">   Covid started a month ago and came without any warning.</p>
        <p>
        We were forced to be shut into our homes with what <em> little </em> toilet paper and food we had. Companies like doordash and grubhub making <strong id="bad"> billions </strong> off us. Although my family and I are safe in our homes, the <em> inevitable doom of boredom slowly creeps into each of our lives</em>. I've decided to document my experiences on this blog about my Covid experience. <em> Maybe this pandemic will pass over soon</em>.</p>

        <p> Test test test. Ok good, this is working now. <span style="color:rgb(200, 99, 255)">Due to the recent riots and conspiracies about Covid, the power to my house has been going off and on</span> . My job is laying off <strong class="bad"> tons </strong> of people. Most of my co-workers have "resigned" from their positions. It's not just my job that's taking a hit from this pandemic, it's <strong class="bad"> millions </strong>, maybe even <strong class="bad"> billions </strong> across the world. It doesn't seem like the pandemic is getting any better either, <span id="sickanddying"> people are still getting sick and dying</span>. With winter coming, the <strong class="bad"> Flu </strong> is just going to make things worse. My family and I are having a virtual thanksgiving dinner next week. It's nice to talk to family but it doesn't feel the same through a video camera. My sanity is wearing off as I'm getting more bored with my life. I want to work overtime but there's too many people who want to do the same as me. <span class="fontstyle"> I don't think this pandemic is going to end anytime soon. </span> </p>

        <p> So much for "daily" entries, there's not much to write about in these times to write entries everyday or even weekly. That's how dull life is right now. I want to hang out with friends and try out new things. I kind of want to start dating but of course, we are in quarantine. And plus, I don't exactly meet the requirments for most girls my age (20). Even though we're all stuck inside, I've been having lots of fun gaming online with my friends. We have days of the week and certain times we all get online and play a game together. We play Minecraft, The Master Chief Collection, Fortnite, Apex Legends, Roblox, you name it. Though, we would much rather meet in real life and talk rather than speak with eachother through Discord. Honestly, I don't remember the last time I've spoke to someone face-to-face. I really hope this pandemic is going to be over soon. This'll be an interesting time to reflect on when I'm older. </p>
